## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to demonstrate the ride-sharing situation of three different city types among hundreds of cities.

## Summary
Advice 1#: There is big demand of sharing-ride in rural area. It would be great to arrange more drivers from urban area to rural area.

Advice 2#: The average amount of per ride in rural area is much higher than that in urban area. I think there is a need to use different pricing system in differnt city types to narrow the gap.

Advice 3#: The average fare of per driver in urban area is much lower than other two city types. I think a differnt income calculating system for the drivers should be applied to balance the differnces.
